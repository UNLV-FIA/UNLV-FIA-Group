### Important Notes:

- Ensure newly added images are similar in size (200x200) or that they are cropped/expanded evenly to fit size requirements. All images should be compressed and stored within the appropriate assets folder
- Ensure newly added divs, buttons, dialogs, etc. are given unique IDs (if an ID was necessary for that element)
- Ensure your updated employee profile hasn't disrupted the functionality/information of any existing employee
